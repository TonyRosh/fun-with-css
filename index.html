      <p>I've been spending my days studying the ways of <strong>web
        development</strong>. Learning the ins and outs of <em><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language" id="html1">HTML</abbr></em>, <em><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets" id="css1">CSS</abbr></em>, and <em><abbr title="The Language Of The Web!" id="js1">JavaScript</abbr></em>, and using them to bring webpages to life, like the one you're visiting right now!</p>
      <br>
      <p>Using apps like <strong><a href="https://getmimo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mimo</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://programminghub.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Programming Hub</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://www.sololearn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SoloLearn</a></strong> really helped me start this adventure, but I am now enrolled at <strong><a href="https://flatironschool.com/welcome-to-flatiron-school/?utm_source=Google&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=1783325438&utm_content=75897432663&utm_term=flatiron%20scholarship&uqaid=488305145646&EAIaIQobChMI6L-kvb_-7wIVQ_HACh1wrgyUEAAYASAAEgIgz_D_BwE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6L-kvb_-7wIVQ_HACh1wrgyUEAAYASAAEgIgz_D_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flatiron School</a></strong> and I can't wait to fully immerse myself in the world of coding!</p>
      <br>
      <p>I hope you enjoy that little video of my pup! Her name is Blanca, and (when I'm not studying code) she is my world!</p>
      <p>My journey into software engineering started in January of 2021. I was in the restaurant industry for 15 years until the pandemic caused my restaurant to close. I wasn't sure I wanted to find another food service job, and I had some family who had recently completed a coding boot camp, much like <a href="https://flatironschool.com/welcome-to-flatiron-school/?utm_source=Google&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=1783325438&utm_content=75897432663&utm_term=flatiron%20scholarship&uqaid=488305145646&EAIaIQobChMI6L-kvb_-7wIVQ_HACh1wrgyUEAAYASAAEgIgz_D_BwE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6L-kvb_-7wIVQ_HACh1wrgyUEAAYASAAEgIgz_D_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flatiron School</a>. They convinced me that it was a path I needed to follow, so I downloaded a few coding apps to see what it was like. The more I dove into those apps, the more I enjoyed the process and I eventually decided this was something I wanted to pursue! I did some research and found Flatiron School and decided to apply. My courses start on April 26th, and I am very excited to step into the world of coding!</p>
      <br>
      <p>When I'm not coding or playing with my dog, you can usually catch me producing music or enjoying a spooky horror film. If you are into EDM (more specifically, dubstep) then feel free to give my music a listen on SoundCloud here: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/musicpizzasnax" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snax</a>! If you have horror movie suggestions, I am all ears!</p>
      <br>
      <p>Denver, Colorado has been home to me my whole life, but I recently also bought property the beautiful city of Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, Mexico! That has been my favorite place in the world to vacation to for years, and I am thrilled to call it my part time home now! I will be renting my condo when I'm not there, so if you're interested in taking a vacation to Mexico, feel free to reach out for details!!</p>
